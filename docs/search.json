More details will be provided to registered attendees.\n\n\nWhat would be good uses for an R package?\n\nYou have a set of functions repeated across R scripts that you would like to register as a collection within an R package.\nYou have a Shiny App you would like to share with colleagues so they can run it locally (for example) on their laptops.\nYou have a function that runs a simulation/estimation/analysis that you plan or are already using repeatedly.\nYou have some data that you would like to share with others or yourself in a simpler way.\nEtc.\n\n\n\nWho should attend?\nR programming users looking to learn how to write an R package, hopefully already having an idea/project for their own package. What level of programming should attendees have? Attendees should have experience using the R programming language. To get the most out of the workshop, they should have a working knowledge of programming concepts such as writing functions data manipulation using tools like dplyr, base R, or data.table.\n\n\nWhat tools will be used during the workshop?\nBesides the R programming language, we will be using Rstudio."
