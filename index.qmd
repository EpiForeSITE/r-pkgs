R packages are a fundamental tool for reproducibility and code sharing. Scientists and data analysts can use R packages to share new methods and improve data processing pipelines. This workshop is designed to provide a practical introduction to developing R packages. The workshop will be structured in two parts: Practical foundations of writing and a hackathon. The practical foundations will provide a start-to-finish example that attendees can follow. The hackathon component will be oriented to developing attendeesâ€™ own R packages, expecting them to complete the workshop with their own package.

## About the workshop

### Time and location

The workshop will take place on Friday, November 8th, 2024 at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT. More details will be provided to registered attendees.

### What would be good uses for an R package?

-	You have a set of functions repeated across R scripts that you would like to register as a collection within an R package.
-	You have a Shiny App you would like to share with colleagues so they can run it locally (for example) on their laptops.
-	You have a function that runs a simulation/estimation/analysis that you plan or are already using repeatedly.
-	You have some data that you would like to share with others or yourself in a simpler way.
-	Etc.


### Who should attend?

R programming users looking to learn how to write an R package, hopefully already having an idea/project for their own package.
What level of programming should attendees have?
Attendees should have experience using the R programming language. To get the most out of the workshop, they should have a working knowledge of programming concepts such as writing functions data manipulation using tools like dplyr, base R, or data.table.


### What tools will be used during the workshop?

Besides the R programming language, we will be using Rstudio.
